# Foodie
This is a recipe app that lets you search for recipe in various ways through an application:

## Main Goal

This app was developed as a side project. <br/>
The Users of this application can : <br/>
• Sign-up (Register) & Sign-in (Login) <br/>
• Search recipes by recipe categories (meal type, dish type) <br/>
• Find recipes by filtering by meal type, dish type and calorie range (min - max) <br/>
• Upload user photo to profile <br/>
• Add / Remove a recipe to favorites <br/>

<br/>

Other implementations: <br/>
• Personalised user greeting with their name according to what hour is it on home screen <br/>
• Personalised recipe results on home screen according to what hour is it

### Next Sprint Tasks
a) Allow users to reset their password
b) Allow users to edit their profile data <br/>
c) Add a favorite counter in the profile screen </br>
d) Research how a search with filters can be implemented for the Search Screen

### Ideas for further development 

a) Integrate Onboarding Screens <br/>
